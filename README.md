# Legend of Hondo
A single player Star Wars experience based upon SWGEmu.

www.tpot.ca - The Power of Text

This is a project I started back in 2014 for something creative to enjoy on my own. I set it down for several months to do other things, but I decided to rebuild it and share it now that I am familiar with git. The initial code base was pulled from the unstable branch of the SWGEmu Gerrit in June, 2015. I may or may not merge more from upstream at a later date.

Legend of Hondo is not intended to be a "live" or "production" SWGEmu sever. Not at all. It's simply a personal project I am doing for the sake of doing so. Therefore, should you choose to use any of the code in this repo for any purpose, you do so entirely at your own risk and with absolutely no suggested or implied warranty or support from R. Bassett Jr. (Tatwi). That said, you're welcome to use any code or concepts you find here in your own projects.

Here are some of my general thoughts and design goals. Some of these things I already created last year, but I am starting over from scratch so even those things may change the second time around.

# Roleplay Introduction

Based upon SWGEmu (which itself is based upon Star Wars Galaxies from 2004), Legend of Hondo seeks to be a unique Star Wars experience that can be enjoyed by a single player or a small group of friends. By no means does LoH try to recreate the SWG we knew and loved. Instead, LoH begins the tale of a fledgling pirate, you, in a galaxy of mystery, wonder, and conflict. 
 
You start your adventures on Tatooine, as a member of Nyms gang of pirates. Through your younger years, growing up in Nym's Hovel on the planet Lok, you were inspired by the tales you heard of Hondo Ohnaka, the renown pirate from Florrum who enjoyed many adventures during the Clone Wars.  
 
One day, after being picked up by the Empire and dumped on Tatooine as a "refugee" (which is Imperial for, "anyone we've messed with and we don't want to hear from again") while you were on a perfectly legitimate trip to tour the cities of Naboo, you decided that you had to stop coasting through life. You had to build a name for yourself. Sure, Nym knew you by name and all, but you weren't ranked high in his order. Anyone could mess with you, Empire, Rebellion, Jabba the Hutt... it didn't matter. Ultimately, as respected as you were, you were replaceable and not worth the risk to rescue. 
 
So, you called in some favors and gathered a small crew, a nice combination of life-long friends and general riff-raff,  and set about procuring a ship. All pirates need a ship! After a few smaller heists on Tatooine, mostly Imperial supply runs, you and your crew managed to score the big time when you teamed up with an old friend for an off world caper. 
 
In an amusing twist of fate, you found a beat up old Incom X-4 Gunship buried in a swamp while you and your crew were lost Yavin4 - after being double crossed by your former partner, of course. The ship's log indicated that it was being ferried to some rebel hideout for outfitting, but you're pretty sure it never made it, because apart from the mud and snakes it didn't look very lived in when you found it. In any case, it had long since been forgotten by its original owners, so you tidied it up and used its radio to call the mining outpost for some help.  Pretty amazing how a handful of credits and a bottle of whiskey was enough to subdue any questions from the local forman and his crew, who made quick work of sucking YOUR ship out of the muck... 
 
So here you are, ready to start building your own pirate legacy. Let the adventures begin!

# Design Points

Have a peak into the "LoH - Feature Log" file for what I have completed and what I will be working on. Most of what is listed is stuff I did before, but back then I did things as I thought of them. This time I have organized my customizations into "feature chunks" so they're easier for others who come later to understand. Each commit to the repo will be a complete feature (plus hotfixes for typos, adjustments, etc...).

Enjoy, 

- Tatwi

Ps. I have included the additional files needed for some of these customizations in the tre folder. You can use Sytner's Iff Editor to repack the tre folder into a .tre file, then include that file on your client and server. Or you can download just the parts you want.
