- Datapad Increases: 5 Pets (CAN be increase with SEAs and skills), 5 Droids, 5 Vehicles.

Power/Maint/Housing Adjustments
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
scripts/object/installation/[GENERATORS/HARVESTERS]

- Increased Min/Max BER on all harvesters and (less so) generators
- Increased max possible hopper size for harvesters (but not generators).
- Reduced power and maint costs harvesters.
- Reduced maint cost on factories and houses/guild halls.
- Left the factory power cost normal, as it only drains when running and a single player doesn't need thousands of blah instantly.
- General idea was to keep power important, but not crippling.
- All small, medium, large houses, guild halls, and player city decore can be built Datooine/Tatooine. 

src/server/zone/objects/building/BuildingObject.idl
src/server/zone/objects/building/BuildingObjectImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Player houses have 300 item storage per lot. 
- Civic structures have 1000 item storage. 
- Any building that does not require lots has 1000 item storage.

src/server/zone/managers/planet/PlanetManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Allowed placing player structures in NPC cities.

src/server/zone/managers/structure/StructureManager.cpp
- - - - - - -
- No longer checks if there is "enough space" to place an object or building, so objects and buildings can be placed where ever. 
- Also allows lamp posts to be placed on the steps of buildings, etc. 

src/server/zone/objects/creature/commands/RotateFurnitureCommand.h
src/server/zone/objects/scene/SceneObject.idl
src/server/zone/objects/scene/SceneObjectImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Allowed items placed inside structures to be rotated on all three axis






Medic, Medicine, and Buffs
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
scripts/object/tangible/beta/beta_terminal_wound.lua
scripts/screenplays/hondo/buff_terminals.lua
- - - - - - -
- Terminal name is "Wound Terminal"
- Modified this unused terminal so that it can be a buff and heal bot. 
- Uses the values that are used for the Character Builder buffs.
- Located inside hospitals on Tatooine (Bestine, Mos Eisley, Mos Entha, Mos Espa)
- Heals battle fatigue.
- Removes DoTs, because sometimes they get bugged.
- Removes buffs and empties stomach, because sometimes they get bugged.
- Does not heal health/action wounds, but does heal mind wounds and battle fatigue.

scripts/managers/player_manager.lua
- - - - - - -
- Medical buffs set to 800.
- Performance buffs set to 400.  

src/server/zone/managers/player/PlayerManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Buff terminal stat changes, limited regen boost (to encourage Medic "active healing" game play)
- Charges 5,000 credits (taken from cash on hand).
- 800 Heath / Action / Mind 
- 400 Strength / Quickness / Focus.
- 100 Constitution / Stamina / Willpower.
- The player can still craft medial and food buffs. 

src/server/zone/objects/creature/buffs/PerformanceBuffImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Disabled Entertainer buffs, because the process sucked and is useless in a single player environment.

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_a.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_b.lua

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_d.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_e.lua
- - - - - - -
- Increased the min/max values on Stim-A/B/C.
- Increase the min values on Stim-D/E. These remain the most potent.

src/server/zone/objects/creature/commands/HealDamageCommand.h
src/server/zone/objects/creature/commands/HealWoundCommand.h
- - - - - - -
- Healing self and healing pets with the Medic abilities now grants XP, for damage and wounds.
- Damage Healing XP awarded = 25% power of the health + action healed (default)
- Wound Healing XP awarded = 2.5x power of the heal (default)
- This was done in the hopes people could level by actually playing the game, rather than doing it AFK with a second character. 
- The 3x global XP rate on top of the default XP values really make it nice to level Medic while out leveling the combat classes.

src/server/zone/managers/sui/SuiManager.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Disabled wound healing using the Buff Terminal and Character Builder Terminal (blue frog). 
- People can heal wounds with the dirt cheap Medic skills rather than the Buff Terminal!
- Retained the Mind wound Battle Fatigue healing option, so as to no require Entertainer.


scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_action_c.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_action_d.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_health_c.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_health_d.lua
- - - - - - -
- Reduced the max possible experimentation, because default SWG Doc buffs made the game way too easy.
- They will still be better than the Buff Terminal with a decked out Doctor.

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_constitution_a.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_constitution_b.lua

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_stamina_d.lua
- Nerfed all regen buffs into the ground to encourage "active healing". 
- Top end went from 800 down to 200, but with a Doc suit that will go quite a bit more than 200.

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_strength_c.lua

scripts/commands/unarmedHeadHit1.lua
- - - - - - -
- Changed all specials that direactly damaged Mind directly to damage Health or Action instead
- Specials that hit a random pool still have a 15% chance to hit the Mind pool.
- This will effect both players and NPCs.
- The idea being it normalized professions such that drilling down the weakest spot, Mind, isn't THE ONLY way to play the game. And, in a group no class is useless for "doing the wrong kind of damage", becuase every class can hit Health or Action with their specials. DoTs and random hits will still take the Mind down, but at least it's more strategic than "SPAM MY MIND HIT SPECIAL!!!"...

- - - - - - -
- These specials were utterly punishing for leveling players, so I made them more like Body Shot, which works well with starter gear/skill.
- Mostly accuracy increases.

scripts/mobile/hondo/travel/*
- - - - - - -
- Added character conversation based travel from Mos Espa to various locations on Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, and Lok.
- Travel from Mos Espa to a safe harbor is 5,000 credits.
- Travel from Mos Espa to a dungeon is 10,000 credits.
- Travel back to Mos Espa is free.
- Add a replacement shuttle port system for public transport on Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, and Tatooine. Tickets are 250 credits.

- - - - - - -
- Disable Ticket Terminals, Ticket Droids, and replaced NPC shuttles with a static model.
- Tatooine starport shuttles remain disabled so as to no overlap with the Onak, which is parked in Mos Espa.






Scout and Ranger
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
src/server/zone/managers/creature/CreatureManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Any creature that usually drops less than 30 units in SWG will drop roughly 30 units for Master Rangers and around 2 units for Novice Scouts. The value increases gradually as the player gains more Creature Harvesting skill.
- Novice and Master Rangers will both grant and be personally granted the harvest bonus when in a group. For a non Ranger to get this bonus, they must be within 64m of the Ranger. Of course, the Ranger is always in range of himself! :)
- The group bonus thing was a fix I made for the Tarkin server and I added it here even though there isn't a group XP bonus in Legend of Hondo (at this time).

src/server/zone/managers/minigames/ForageManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Grant Wilderness Survival XP for the following:
- Scout Foraging Success 
- Searching Lair Success (+ 15 bonus XP)
- Shellfish Survey Tool Success
- Medical Foraging Success (50% WS XP, but grants 100% Medical XP)
- XP Amounts: Min 1, Max 135 (+15 for lair searching), with foraging skill mod increasing the chance for higher XP. 

src/server/zone/managers/minigames/ForageManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Slightly improved the chance to find Eggs rather than Creature Samples, based on Creature Harvesting Skill. 

scripts/mobile/corellia/murra.lua
- - - - - - -
- Fixed ability to be milked 

src/server/zone/objects/creature/events/MilkCreatureTask.h
- - - - - - -
- XP on Milking Success  
- Tested Milkable Creature Types: Bageraset, Humbaba, Paralope, Sharnaff(2), Piket, Thune, Bolma, Brackaset, Bolle Bol, 
Bantha, Gurnaset, Snorbal, Falumpaset, Fambaa(7), Gualama, Ikopi, Kaduu, Murra, Kahmurra, Cu Pa, Eopie, Ronto(3),
Tybis, Lesser Plains Bol, Bordok.

- - - - - - -
- Added new Hunting Mission Spawn Groups (as there weren't any appropriate groups already)
- When I went to add Wilderness Survival XP to these missions, I discovered that they were not implimented correctly. Apart
from the generally poor way SOE made these missions, SWGEmu seems to have based the potential targets off any 
possible MOB spawn on any planet, which is incorrect (and in some cases, out-right broken as it includes faction NPC, some 
of which don't even spawn). Consiquently, I went ahead and solved this problem by creating new spawn groups for each 
planet that consist of only valid animal type creatures. Most (if not all) non-quest, non-dungeon animals that can spawn on 
a planet are available.

src/server/zone/managers/mission/MissionManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Completely changed how the available creature types are determined.
- All available creature types are displayed in the mission terminal, regardless of player level and group size. Just because you take the mission, doesn't mean you'll actually find those creatures! :)
- Adjusted the mission credit payout method to more appropriately match the difficulty of the mission. Reward range is approx 450cr to 25,000cr. Creature Knowledge skill grants a bonus!
- Difficulty level displayed is now the average level of the target creatures (rather than the not very helpful 1, 2, or 3 that used to be displayed).
- Removed the roleplay from the mission descriptions server side, for clarity and to fix SOE typos without requiring a client update.
- Titles for Hunting Missions on the terminals show the target creature name rather than the roleplay name. [Animal]: a humbaba 

src/server/zone/objects/mission/HuntingMissionObjectiveImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Granted Wilderness Survival XP upon completion.
- XP granted is based upon your Foraging skill and the credit payout, so SEAs can be used for bonus XP!

src/server/zone/objects/mission/MissionObjectImplementation.cpp
src/server/zone/objects/mission/HuntingMissionObjectiveImplementation.cpp
src/server/zone/packets/mission/MissionObjectDeltaMessage3.h
- - - - - - -
- Mission description, when viewed in the datapad, now shows how many kills are remaining.
- Unfortunately, the text is loaded from the client side files by default each time you log in, but it gets updated again once you kill one of the mission creatures.
- Titles for Hunting Missions on the terminals show the target creature name rather than the roleplay name. [Kill 15]: a humbaba

src/server/zone/managers/mission/MissionManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Titles for Destroy Missions on the terminals show the target creature name rather than the roleplay name. [Difficulty 9]: humbaba lair

- - - - - - -
- Adjusted the Min/Max/Speed ranges for crafted versions such that they can actually be better than the ones granted for free to Brawler/Marksman (and the ones sold by the Starter Weapons vendor).
- This always bugged me about the starter weapons - a perfectly crafted one was still not as good as a free one! Why even have them? lol... Now, that they can be better than the free ones there is a point to making them.


scripts/object/tangible/wearables/armor/[ARMORSET]
- - - - - - -
- Changed the default values so the sets can be sold by NPCs as basic armor sets.
- Crafted armor will cover all stats except stun and lightsaber, with some stats being special resists on some armor types. 
- Stun and Lightsaber are the only vulnerabilities (for sake of ease).
- Max condition ranges between 30k - 45k
- Bone/Mabari/IthDefender/KashBlack: 24 Kin, 24 Eng, 12 Ele, 4 Acid / 40H, 20A, 20M
- Tantel/Ubese/: 20 Kin, 40 Eng, 4 Ele, 12 Acid / 40H, 20A, 20M
- Chitin/Marauder: 40 Kin, 20 Eng, 12 Ele, 4 Acid / 40H, 20A, 20M

- Reduced the highest possible encumberance values from 20 to 8.
- Secondary stat buffs are lower and encumberance values on crafted armor can easily make a piece useless.

- - - - - - -
- Reduced the highest possible encumberance values.
- Increased the condition and effectiveness on advanced segments
- These crafted segments added too much encumberance. 


scripts/object/tangible/wearables/armor/bone/[ARMORPIECE]
scripts/object/tangible/wearables/armor/zam/[ARMORPIECE]
- - - - - - -
- Brought the min base effectiveness up from 1 to 10 and the max base effectiveness up from 20 to 30. 

scripts/loot/items/creature/[Armor Components].lua
- - - - - - -
- Revamped the following looted armor components so that they're genuinely useful.
- Reduced Encumberance values.
- Brackaset Plates: Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat with a bonus to Blast. Small HAM bonus possible.
- Famba Plates: Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat with a bonus to Cold. Small HAM bonus possible.
- Sharnaff Plates: Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat with a bonus to Heat. Small HAM bonus possible.
- Voritor Scales: Increased max stack size to 20.
- Kimogila Scales: Made these an upgrade to Voritor Scales by making them Energy, Kinetic, Acid and improving the min/max values. Min stack size is 3, max is also 20. Kimo's have the best Acid resit.
- Krayt Dragon Scales: Made these the ultimate upgrade for lizard scales by increasing the Energy and Kinetic min/max values and leaving the Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat. Min stack size is 3, but max is only 12.

scripts/loot/items/creature/[Armor Segments].lua
scripts/loot/items/geonosian_lab/kliknik_reinforced_chitin_armor_segment.lua

Crafting Loot, XP, and Timings 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
src/server/zone/objects/player/sessions/crafting/CraftingSessionImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Changed the Practice Mode XP bonus when crafting from 5% to 75%.
- Removed crafting tool timer (1 second per item). 
- Granted a chance to win a piece of loot (Junk to good quality SEAs) while crafting using practice mode.
- Loot chance is based upon item complexity, tool quality (not station), and assembly skill (appropriate to the item being made).
- Loot quality is based upon the quality of the item created and assembly skill.

MMOCoreORB/src/server/zone/objects/installation/factory/FactoryObjectImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Significantly reduced factory run times, but still based upon item complexity. Min of 1 second per item.

- Increased XP granted to 1250 from 50. 
- 510,000 Crafting XP required for the profession. 
- 170,000 DNA Samping XP required = roughly 380 DNA samples.
- Therefore, 78 crafts in practice mode at 896 XP each (before bonuses) will grant enough XP to level the profession using all the DNA collected to level the DNA Sampling line.






Loot, Junk, and Junk Dealers
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- The general idea with these changes is that with only one player, there isn't any division of labor at all - if the one player doesn't loot it, it doesn't exist! Normally, many players are out there collecting loot and then selling it to other players. Without the combined efforts brought by many players, the default loot system was broken. 
- I've tried to make it such that one person can go about their play and actually have a real chance to earn what they need themselves. However, the amount of time required is still so collossal for a single player that I will later add in an NPC merchant system to augment the lack of players selling, at the very least, basic items.

optional/bin/scripts/managers/loot_manager.lua
- - - - - - -
- Increased the chance of getting a exceptional and legendary item.
- Increased the stat bonus to exceptional and legendary items.
- Increased the chance to find an SEA.
- Made both SEA types have the same full array of stat possibilities.

- Junk Dealers, in this single player game, are a primary source of income. They are the ONLY people can sell anything to! 
- Junk Dealers will now purchase the items listed above, as well as other misc items.

src/server/zone/objects/resource/ResourceManager.idl
- - - - - - -
- Reduced the Crate of Free Resource to 500 units.

scripts/loot/groups/junk.lua
- - - - - - -
- Anything that can drop junk now has a chance to drop an SEA instead.
- SEA quality is based on the creature level, so this is self balancing.
- Can also drop Crate of Free Resources (Resource Deed)

scripts/loot/groups/tailor_components.lua
- - - - - - -
- Added most crafted Tailor components. Note they do not have a junk dealer value.

scripts/loot/items/hondo/
- - - - - - -
- My custom loot items are in here.

scripts/mobile/[PLANET]/[CREATURE].lua
- - - - - - -
- All wild and lair spawned creatures have the chance to drop junk (including SEAs), clothing, and weapons (in that order).
- With the exception anything that aleady had a loot table.
- Included planets that aren't in use at the moment, as I will later add many of their creatures to the planets are in use.





Skill Terminal
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
scripts/object/tangible/beta/beta_terminal_xp.lua
- Give free profession training for Dancer, Entertainer, Image Designer, Merchant, Musician, Politician.
- None of these professions are worth/possible leveling in a single player environment.
- Also added learning of all languages as well.
- Located in the Mos Espa cantina.





Simple Flight and 24 Hour Limit
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
src/server/zone/managers/player/creation/PlayerCreationManager.cpp
- Add a basic Scyk ship to the datapad of new players. Can be used to fly around on the planets. This feature is rough around the edges, but still cool!
- Removed the 1 character creation per 24 hour limit, because it sucked in general and was plain broken due to the server not being on all the time.
- Customized the welcome message pop-up for Legend of Hondo.

scripts/mobile/conversations/hondo/travel/wolten_kinhara_from_espa_conv.lua
- Updated conversation with some information (and story) about the fighter ship.

NPC Merchants
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- These help fill in the gaps left by the lack of other players looting and selling "stuff".
- Create a better framework for selling items. 
- NPCs will have friends/foes, using the various factions.
- Player relation to the NPC will factor in the price and availability of items. 
- Loot from Geonosian Lab, Imperial/Rebel themeparks, and other unavailable content will be for sale. 
- These merchants are a primary credit sink and accessing them is part of the story/activity driven content.
