scripts/managers/player_creation_manager.lua
- - - - - - -
- Players start with 50,000 credits total.
- New Artisans also get a wind survey tool.
- Every new player gets a backpack.
- All players start with a Tantel Helmet, Chest Plate, and Boots.


scripts/managers/player_manager.lua
- - - - - - -
- 3x Global XP rate.
- Group XP Bonus is 0%, so people don't feel obligated to dual log clients to max XP gain.
- Datapad Increases: 5 Pets (CAN be increase with SEAs and skills), 5 Droids, 5 Vehicles.
- Disabled Anti-Decay Kits and Crate of Free Resources vet rewards. This keeps the universe moving forward, always in flux, always fresh.

- Allow the player to place structures in NPC cities (Credit: Kinshi @ Tarkin.org)
- Has the amusing side effect of allowing lairs to spawn within cities, which is nice for the extra danger and randomness.

Power/Maint/Housing Adjustments
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
scripts/object/installation/[GENERATORS/HARVESTERS]

- Increased Min/Max BER on all harvesters and (less so) generators
- Increased max possible hopper size for harvesters (but not generators).
- Reduced power and maint costs harvesters.
- Reduced maint cost on factories and houses/guild halls.
- Left the factory power cost normal, as it only drains when running and a single player doesn't need thousands of blah instantly.
- General idea was to keep power important, but not crippling.
- All small, medium, large houses, guild halls, and player city decore can be built Datooine/Tatooine. 

src/server/zone/objects/building/BuildingObject.idl
src/server/zone/objects/building/BuildingObjectImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Player houses have 300 item storage per lot. 
- Civic structures have 1000 item storage. 
- Any building that does not require lots has 1000 item storage.

src/server/zone/managers/planet/PlanetManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Allowed placing player structures in NPC cities.

src/server/zone/managers/structure/StructureManager.cpp
- - - - - - -
- No longer checks if there is "enough space" to place an object or building, so objects and buildings can be placed where ever. 
- Also allows lamp posts to be placed on the steps of buildings, etc. 

src/server/zone/objects/creature/commands/RotateFurnitureCommand.h
src/server/zone/objects/scene/SceneObject.idl
src/server/zone/objects/scene/SceneObjectImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Allowed items placed inside structures to be rotated on all three axis






Medic, Medicine, and Buffs
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
scripts/object/tangible/beta/beta_terminal_wound.lua
scripts/screenplays/hondo/buff_terminals.lua
- - - - - - -
- Terminal name is "Wound Terminal"
- Modified this unused terminal so that it can be a buff and heal bot. 
- Uses the values that are used for the Character Builder buffs.
- Located inside hospitals on Tatooine (Bestine, Mos Eisley, Mos Entha, Mos Espa)
- Heals battle fatigue.
- Removes DoTs, because sometimes they get bugged.
- Removes buffs and empties stomach, because sometimes they get bugged.
- Does not heal health/action wounds, but does heal mind wounds and battle fatigue.

scripts/managers/player_manager.lua
- - - - - - -
- Medical buffs set to 800.
- Performance buffs set to 400.  

src/server/zone/managers/player/PlayerManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Buff terminal stat changes, limited regen boost (to encourage Medic "active healing" game play)
- Charges 5,000 credits (taken from cash on hand).
- 800 Heath / Action / Mind 
- 400 Strength / Quickness / Focus.
- 100 Constitution / Stamina / Willpower.
- The player can still craft medial and food buffs. 

src/server/zone/objects/creature/buffs/PerformanceBuffImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Disabled Entertainer buffs, because the process sucked and is useless in a single player environment.

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_a.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_b.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_c.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_d.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/crafted_stimpack_sm_s1_e.lua
- - - - - - -
- Increased the min/max values on Stim-A/B/C.
- Increase the min values on Stim-D/E. These remain the most potent.

src/server/zone/objects/creature/commands/HealDamageCommand.h
src/server/zone/objects/creature/commands/HealWoundCommand.h
- - - - - - -
- Healing self and healing pets with the Medic abilities now grants XP, for damage and wounds.
- Damage Healing XP awarded = 25% power of the health + action healed (default)
- Wound Healing XP awarded = 2.5x power of the heal (default)
- This was done in the hopes people could level by actually playing the game, rather than doing it AFK with a second character. 
- The 3x global XP rate on top of the default XP values really make it nice to level Medic while out leveling the combat classes.

src/server/zone/managers/sui/SuiManager.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Disabled wound healing using the Buff Terminal and Character Builder Terminal (blue frog). 
- People can heal wounds with the dirt cheap Medic skills rather than the Buff Terminal!
- Retained the Mind wound Battle Fatigue healing option, so as to no require Entertainer.


scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_action_c.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_action_d.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_health_c.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_health_d.lua
- - - - - - -
- Reduced the max possible experimentation, because default SWG Doc buffs made the game way too easy.
- They will still be better than the Buff Terminal with a decked out Doctor.

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_constitution_a.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_constitution_b.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_constitution_c.lua

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_stamina_c.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_stamina_d.lua
- Nerfed all regen buffs into the ground to encourage "active healing". 
- Top end went from 800 down to 200, but with a Doc suit that will go quite a bit more than 200.

scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_quickness_c.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_quickness_d.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_strength_c.lua
scripts/object/tangible/medicine/crafted/medpack_enhance_strength_d.lua
- Reduced top end buffs to encourage "active healing".
- A (100), B (200), C (300), D (400)

scripts/commands/unarmedCombo2.lua
scripts/commands/unarmedHeadHit1.lua
- - - - - - -
- Changed all specials that direactly damaged Mind directly to damage Health or Action instead
- Specials that hit a random pool still have a 15% chance to hit the Mind pool.
- This will effect both players and NPCs.
- The idea being it normalized professions such that drilling down the weakest spot, Mind, isn't THE ONLY way to play the game. And, in a group no class is useless for "doing the wrong kind of damage", becuase every class can hit Health or Action with their specials. DoTs and random hits will still take the Mind down, but at least it's more strategic than "SPAM MY MIND HIT SPECIAL!!!"...

scripts/commands/polearmHit2.lua
scripts/commands/unarmedHit1.lua
scripts/commands/unarmedHit2.lua
- - - - - - -
- These specials were utterly punishing for leveling players, so I made them more like Body Shot, which works well with starter gear/skill.
- Mostly accuracy increases.

Travel System
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
scripts/screenplays/hondo/travel/*
scripts/mobile/conversations/hondo/travel/*
scripts/mobile/hondo/travel/*
- - - - - - -
- Added character conversation based travel from Mos Espa to various locations on Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, and Lok.
- Travel from Mos Espa to a safe harbor is 5,000 credits.
- Travel from Mos Espa to a dungeon is 10,000 credits.
- Travel back to Mos Espa is free.
- Add a replacement shuttle port system for public transport on Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, and Tatooine. Tickets are 250 credits.

scripts/object/building/military/outpost_starport.lua
scripts/object/building/player/city/shuttleport_corellia.lua

scripts/object/building/tatooine/starport_tatooine.lua
scripts/screenplays/hondo/travel/galactic_travel_from_theed.lua
- - - - - - -
- Disable Ticket Terminals, Ticket Droids, and replaced NPC shuttles with a static model.
- Tatooine starport shuttles remain disabled so as to no overlap with the Onak, which is parked in Mos Espa.





Scout and Ranger
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
src/server/zone/managers/creature/CreatureManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Any creature that usually drops less than 30 units in SWG will drop roughly 30 units for Master Rangers and around 2 units for Novice Scouts. The value increases gradually as the player gains more Creature Harvesting skill.
- Novice and Master Rangers will both grant and be personally granted the harvest bonus when in a group. For a non Ranger to get this bonus, they must be within 64m of the Ranger. Of course, the Ranger is always in range of himself! :)
- The group bonus thing was a fix I made for the Tarkin server and I added it here even though there isn't a group XP bonus in Legend of Hondo (at this time).

src/server/zone/managers/minigames/ForageManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Grant Wilderness Survival XP for the following:
- Scout Foraging Success 
- Searching Lair Success (+ 15 bonus XP)
- Shellfish Survey Tool Success
- Medical Foraging Success (50% WS XP, but grants 100% Medical XP)
- XP Amounts: Min 1, Max 135 (+15 for lair searching), with foraging skill mod increasing the chance for higher XP. 

src/server/zone/managers/minigames/ForageManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Slightly improved the chance to find Eggs rather than Creature Samples, based on Creature Harvesting Skill. 

scripts/mobile/corellia/murra.lua
- - - - - - -
- Fixed ability to be milked 

src/server/zone/objects/creature/events/MilkCreatureTask.h
- - - - - - -
- Milking Success  
- Tested Milkable Creature Types: Bageraset, Humbaba, Paralope, Sharnaff(2), Piket, Thune, Bolma, Brackaset, Bolle Bol, 
Bantha, Gurnaset, Snorbal, Falumpaset, Fambaa(7), Gualama, Ikopi, Kaduu, Murra, Kahmurra, Cu Pa, Eopie, Ronto(3),
Tybis, Lesser Plains Bol, Bordok.

src/server/zone/objects/area/CampSiteActiveAreaImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Camps grant XP when abandonded. Grants the XP even when client loses connection to the server! 




Weapons and Components

scripts/object/weapon/ranged/pistol/pistol_cdef.lua
scripts/object/weapon/ranged/rifle/rifle_cdef.lua
- - - - - - -
- Adjusted the Min/Max/Speed ranges for crafted versions such that they can actually be better than the ones granted for free to Brawler/Marksman (and the ones sold by the Starter Weapons vendor).
- This always bugged me about the starter weapons - a perfectly crafted one was still not as good as a free one! Why even have them? lol... Now, that they can be better than the free ones there is a point to making them.





Armor and Components

scripts/object/tangible/wearables/armor/ithorian_sentinel/ith_armor_s03_boots.lua

scripts/object/tangible/wearables/armor/zam/armor_zam_wesell_helmet.lua
scripts/object/tangible/wearables/armor/zam/armor_zam_wesell_pants.lua
- - - - - - -
- Set the default values to 15 Kinetic / 15 Energy / 5 Acid / 10,000 Condition for all so that these can be used as starter armor.

scripts/object/tangible/wearables/armor/bone/[ARMORPIECE]
- - - - - - -
- Bone Armor now also has base Kinetic and Acid protection, allowing for useful armor to made without a factory (particularly with looted segments/parts).

scripts/object/tangible/wearables/armor/zam/[ARMORPIECE]
- - - - - - -
- Mabari Armor now also has base Kinetic and Acid protection, allowing for useful armor to made without a factory (particularly with looted segments/parts).
- Brought the min base effectiveness up from 1 to 10 and the max base effectiveness up from 20 to 25. This makes the Kinetic better than the Starter Armor and also gives it a bit of a boost over Bone Armor.

scripts/loot/items/creature/[Armor Components].lua
- - - - - - -
- Revamped the following looted armor components so that they're genuinely useful.
- Reduced Encumberance values where they were too high to make the components worth using.
- Brackaset Plates: Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat with a bonus to Blast. Small HAM bonus possible.
- Famba Plates: Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat with a bonus to Cold. Small HAM bonus possible.
- Sharnaff Plates: Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat with a bonus to Heat. Small HAM bonus possible.
- Voritor Scales: Increased max stack size to 20.
- Kimogila Scales: Made these an upgrade to Voritor Scales by making them Energy, Kinetic, Acid and improving the min/max values. Min stack size is 3, max is also 20. Kimo's have the best Acid resit.
- Krayt Dragon Scales: Made these the ultimate upgrade for lizard scales by increasing the Energy and Kinetic min/max values and leaving the Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat. Min stack size is 3, but max is only 12.

scripts/loot/items/creature/[Armor Segments].lua
scripts/loot/items/geonosian_lab/kliknik_reinforced_chitin_armor_segment.lua
- - - - - - -
- Revamped the following looted armor segments so that they're genuinely useful.
[Chitin Armor]
- Armor Effectiveness normalization 
- Brackaset Segment: Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat with a bonus to Blast and Integrity.
- Sharnaff Segment: Acid, Blast, Cold, Heat with a bonus to Heat and Integrity.
- Kliknik Segment: Increased Integrity bonus and added Health Encumberance bonus.
- Reinforced Kliknik Segment: Increased min/max Armor Effectiveness.
[Padded Armor]
- Rancor Segment: Added Acid and Blast so it covers all resists.
- Famba Segment: Lesser version of a Rancor Segment (lower stats and higher Encumberance).
[Bone Armor]
- Voritor Segment: Increase max stack size to 20.
- Kimogila Segment: Upgraded Voritor scale with better stats, bonus Integrity, and Acid protection. Kimo's have the best Acid resit.





Hunting and Destroy Missions

scripts/mobile/spawn/hunting_mission/tatooine_hunting_missions.lua
scripts/mobile/spawn/hunting_mission/yavin4_hunting_missions.lua
scripts/mobile/spawn/serverobjects.lua
- - - - - - -
- Added new Hunting Mission Spawn Groups (as there weren't any appropriate groups already)
- When I went to add Wilderness Survival XP to these missions, I discovered that they were not implimented correctly. Apart
from the generally poor way SOE made these missions, SWGEmu seems to have based the potential targets off any 
possible MOB spawn on any planet, which is incorrect (and in some cases, out-right broken as it includes faction NPC, some 
of which don't even spawn). Consiquently, I went ahead and solved this problem by creating new spawn groups for each 
planet that consist of only valid animal type creatures. Most (if not all) non-quest, non-dungeon animals that can spawn on 
a planet are available.

src/server/zone/managers/mission/MissionManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Completely changed how the available creature types are determined.
- All available creature types are displayed in the mission terminal, regardless of player level and group size. Just because you take the mission, doesn't mean you'll actually find those creatures! :)
- Adjusted the mission credit payout method to more appropriately match the difficulty of the mission. Reward range is approx 450cr to 25,000cr. Creature Knowledge skill grants a bonus!
- Difficulty level displayed is now the average level of the target creatures (rather than the not very helpful 1, 2, or 3 that used to be displayed).
- Removed the roleplay from the mission descriptions server side, for clarity and to fix SOE typos without requiring a client update.
- Titles for Hunting Missions on the terminals show the target creature name rather than the roleplay name. [Animal]: a humbaba 

src/server/zone/objects/mission/HuntingMissionObjectiveImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Granted Wilderness Survival XP upon completion.
- XP granted is based upon your Foraging skill and the credit payout, so SEAs can be used for bonus XP!

src/server/zone/objects/mission/MissionObject.idl
src/server/zone/objects/mission/MissionObjectImplementation.cpp
src/server/zone/objects/mission/HuntingMissionObjectiveImplementation.cpp
src/server/zone/packets/mission/MissionObjectDeltaMessage3.h
- - - - - - -
- Mission description, when viewed in the datapad, now shows how many kills are remaining.
- Unfortunately, the text is loaded from the client side files by default each time you log in, but it gets updated again once you kill one of the mission creatures.
- Titles for Hunting Missions on the terminals show the target creature name rather than the roleplay name. [Kill 15]: a humbaba

src/server/zone/managers/mission/MissionManagerImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Titles for Destroy Missions on the terminals show the target creature name rather than the roleplay name. [Difficulty 9]: humbaba lair 





Loot, Junk, and Junk Dealers
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
scripts/loot/items/attachment_armor.lua
scripts/loot/items/attachment_clothing.lua
scripts/loot/items/skill_buff/*.lua
scripts/loot/items/painting/painting_[NAME]_wanted.lua
scripts/loot/items/loot_schematic/*.lua
scripts/loot/items/creature/*.lua
- - - - - - -
- Junk Dealers will purchase SEAs, Looted Skill Buffs, Wanted Posters, Creature Segments/Plates, and Loot Schematics.

scripts/loot/groups/junk.lua
- - - - - - -
- Any NPC that can drop junk now has a chance to drop an SEA instead.

scripts/mobile/[PLANET]/[ANIMAL].lua
- - - - - - -
- All wild and lair spawned animals have the chance to drop junk, clothing, and SEAs.

Also TODO
- - - - - - -
- Reduce the Crate of Free Resource to 500 units.
- Add it to the junk loot group with the same chance as an SEA.
- Add it to high end mob and loot container loot groups with a good chance to drop.
- Add it to the loot while crafting loot group.
- This THE solution to the issue of not being able harvest specific resources from the disabled planets. I was going to add a resource broker NPC, but this is a better solution, because it encourages people to get out there and play the game AND it was far less complicated to program. Many thanks to Kinshi for the suggestion!





Crafting: Loot and XP 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
src/server/zone/objects/player/sessions/crafting/CraftingSessionImplementation.cpp
	Line 1187
- - - - - - -
- Changed the Practice Mode XP bonus when crafting from 5% to 250%.

src/server/zone/objects/player/sessions/crafting/CraftingSessionImplementation.cpp
- - - - - - -
- Granted a chance to win a piece of loot (Junk to good quality SEAs) while crafting using practice mode.
- Loot chance is based upon item complexity, tool quality (not station), and assembly skill (appropriate to the item being made).
- Loot quality is based upon the quality of the item created and assembly skill.
- The idea here is two fold, to remove resources from the game and to give non-combat folks a chance at getting skill enhancing attachments. It's a new crafting mini-game!

scripts/object/draft_schematic/bio_engineer/dna_template/dna_template_generic.lua
- - - - - - -
- Increased XP granted to 896 from 50. 
- 510,000 Crafting XP required for the profession. 
- 170,000 DNA Samping XP required = roughly 380 DNA samples.
- Therefore, 76 crafts in practice mode at 896 XP each (before bonuses) will grant enough XP to level the profession using all the DNA collected to level the DNA Sampling line.
- So, if you practice mode every sample you collect, due to the 250% practice mode and the 3x XP rate, you'll have a nice shortcut to leveling.

Crafting Tool and Factory Timing Changes
- - - - - - -
- I decided against doing these again, as I feel they remove content from the player; In a single player environment where there is no need to mass produce items and the tool wait time can be partly overcome by making one's self more tools.

Also TODO
- - - - - - -
- Added a chance for bonus XP on assembly amazing success and critical failure.
- Added a chance for loot when on an amazing success when experimenting.
