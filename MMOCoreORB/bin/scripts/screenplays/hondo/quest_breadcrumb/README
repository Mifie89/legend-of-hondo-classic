-- Legend of Hondo Bread Crumb Quests

This a system based on work I did for a new player quest for the Tarkin server. 
It's modeled after the race track logic, because it has similar functionality. 
The player is given a waypoint that he must reach and once he gets there, he is
provided another waypoint. This repeats until all the waypoints are reached and
the player is given a reward.

Each step of the quest provides the player with a custom text update. This allows
the quest creator to teach the player where things are or to give them clues or
other information, role play text, etc. It's a really simple kind of quest, but
it's real power lies in what the player can do at the location you've taken him
to. That was the point of the new player quest on Tarkin, to show the player
where "stuff" is and that's why I originally added it to Legend of Hondo as well.

Unlike the system I created for Merchants, each bread crumb quest screenplay is
its own independant entity. I chose to make them in this manner so that they the 
quest structure could be modified without haivng to change every other quest that
used the same system. However, for the most part they all follow the same formula.
