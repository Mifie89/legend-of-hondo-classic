Legend of Hondo is a personal project that I am working on as a way to learn the ins and outs of the SWGEmu code base and server administration. My primary focus is creating an environment that is true to the spirit of Star Wars Galaxies, while at the same time making it play smoothly without other players. Legend of Hondo is, at the end of the day, just another heavily customized SWGEmu server, so it is possible to fire it up and play it yourself.Given the enormous size of the virtual machine and data files that comprise the server and massive size of the git repository, most of which is irrelevant to the changes that I have made, I've decided to just upload the bin/scripts and src directories. Much of those are also redundant due to the [url=http&#58;//review&#46;swgemu&#46;com/gitweb?p=Core3&#46;git;a=tree;f=MMOCoreORB;h=e598ea92fbd1d6ecd519c87441fdfd9bc1ed05c8;hb=HEAD:13622bmm]SWGEmu repo[/url:13622bmm] and irrelevant to my changes as well, but oh well - it was easy to upload. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> If you'd liked to make your own Legend of Hondo server, you'll need to reference the change log below and replace any file on your SWGEmu server that I have changed with one that I have uploaded, recompile, and reboot the server.

Besides, I can fit over 115MB of text files into less than 5MB of tar.bz2 files, which is great for me!  <!-- s:lol: --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /><!-- s:lol: --> If you want to use any of this code, it's here on the site to use.
