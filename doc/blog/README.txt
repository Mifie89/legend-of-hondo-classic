These files are backups of Legend of Hondo related posts that I made 
on my the Wordpress.com blog, tatwi.wordpress.com, which I call 
The Power of Text (www.tpot.ca). The files are blog formated text,
complete with tags, so they can be a bit hard to read, but they are
here "just in case" you need them.

Files with the words FIXME in them were pulled from a SQL backup file and are pretty messed up, but the words are all there.
