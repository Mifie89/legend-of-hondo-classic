Adding a character or object to the world using a screenplay is very easy. It can be done within a single text file and only a few lines of code. Giving an NPC a conversation they can have with a player is a little more involved, but once you understand where things go and what they do, it's not too difficult to create interactive custom characters.A custom character consists of three files, 1. A Character Template that describes what model you're using and what attributes it has. 2. A Screenplay that loads the character (and any associated decor, etc) and handles what happens to the character when the player interacts with it.3. A Conversation Template that contains all the screens (or &quot;stages&quot;/&quot;steps&quot;) that are possible when talking with the character.When you step back and look at it as a whole, this structure makes sense, because it keeps things neat and tidy while also easy to understand. For a huge project such as SWGEMu, it's important to keep the code as organized as possible. This is why I decided to place these tutorial items where they are supposed to actually go in a production server, rather than creating a bunch of one-off &quot;test&quot; folder. It's better to get used to using the actual file structure. [i:odp8n2iw]Note: When creating Lua scripts for SWGEmu, I use the Scite programming text editor and the system file manager in Linux. I search for word values in the scripts using grep in a command line window (grep -R &quot;search-term&quot; *). For me this is an easy and fast workflow.[/i:odp8n2iw]Here are the locations where the files for this project reside,[b:odp8n2iw]Character Template[/b:odp8n2iw]workspace/Core3/MMOCoreORB/bin/scripts/mobile/quest/naboo/merch_crazy_larry.lua[b:odp8n2iw]Screenplay[/b:odp8n2iw]workspace/Core3/MMOCoreORB/bin/scripts/screenplays/tasks/naboo/merch_crazy_larry.lua[b:odp8n2iw]Conversation Template[/b:odp8n2iw]workspace/Core3/MMOCoreORB/bin/scripts/mobile/conversations/tasks/merch_crazy_larry_conv.luaYou can name your files anything you like. I named my character Crazy Larry and prefaced the file names with merch, in case I go on later to make more of these NPC merchants. I think they could be a really fun way to include a lot of the content that SOE put in the TRE files, but never got around to putting into the game for players to use. Lots of fun can be had in these conversations! <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) --> Crazy Larry is actually pretty tame...OK, let's start with creating a custom character.
