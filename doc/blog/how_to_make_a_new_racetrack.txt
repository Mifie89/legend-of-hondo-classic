<em><strong>Update:</strong> I noticed that I forgot to change the "badge" granted for completing the track from Keren to something new. So, have a look at <a href="http://www.modthegalaxy.com/forums/thread-guide-content-adding-badges" target="_blank">Lasko's guide to creating new badges</a> over on Mod the Galaxy if you want to do that.</em> 

The good folks who created the racetrack system for SWGEmu did so in such a way that it proved to be very easy to make a new one for the Tarkin server. We wanted something to introduce new players to some of the useful places in the starter city, Theed, and it occurred to me that a race track might be a fun way to accomplish the task. Races in Star Wars Galaxies are basically a series of waypoints a person travels to in succession, so... pretty handy and fun way to show a new player around, no? :)

Racetracks are made up of four lua files and two string files. The lua files are plain text files, where as the two string files are a special file type that can be edited with Sytner's Iff Editor, Jawa Toolbox, or TRE Editor. You can browse the lua files on my Github <a href="https://github.com/Tatwi/tarkin_scripts/commit/2ec7aec2d9dbb863329cbfe2d98b368dcb1fa15f" target="_blank">here</a> and download the TRE file <a href="https://github.com/Tatwi/tarkin_scripts/blob/22f176a1cf835a8e89801d5b825eefb619d8463a/NEWTRE/theed_race.tre" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you're confused by what is in those files, it essentially boils down to this:

1. All I did to create this race was copy the existing files for the Keren race and add some new entries to the one string file that is shared between all races.

2. I put all the files in the right spots and registered them with the engine (including using Sytner's Iff Editor to pack a new TRE file, so the server can register it as well as adding it my to client).

3. Changed the word Keren to Theed in all the files (Being sure to MATCH THE CASE!).

4. Made new waypoints for the droid and the race by driving around Tarkin and marking them down as I went.

5. Added some custom screen messages in the string files, as well as entries for each step in the race. Again, I simply used the Keren race as a template.

<strong>scripts/mobile/conversations.lua</strong>
- Registers the conversation for the new race droid.

<strong>scripts/mobile/conversations/racetracks/theedconversation.lua</strong>
- Is the conversation for the new race droid. 
- This stuff is fed into the "race engine" and there is very little you need to change here.
- Simply change the word theed (using the "replace all" tool in your text editor!) to what you're calling your new race. 

<strong>scripts/mobile/misc/serverobjects.lua</strong>
- Register the new race droid.

<strong>scripts/mobile/misc/theedracecoordinator.lua</strong>
- The new race droid himself.
- Required because it points to the above new conversation, which must be unique.

<strong>scripts/screenplays/racetracks/racetracks.lua</strong>
- Register the new racetrack.

<strong>scripts/screenplays/racetracks/theed.lua</strong>
- The screenplay that feeds all the data into the "race engine". 
- All you change here are the names, Theed/theed in this case, and the waypoints. 


That's it. Provided you haven't made any typos, mixed up or forgotten any name changes, or neglected to register the new TRE file in your conf/config.lua file on the server, you will have a new race track. No real need to comprehend the underlying system, thanks to the clever way the SWGEmu folks designed their "race engine". 

May the Force be with you!
