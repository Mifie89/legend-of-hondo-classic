As a learning tool, this project has proven to be great! I have reset the server for various reasons three or four times, each a useful learning experience. The two big ones were, 1. I blew up the resource database, as only loading one planet at time failed to create a functional resource (Berkley) database.2. I placed a ton of houses in Coronet to test out a mod I am working on. The mod works, I &quot;just&quot; need to make a new command to allow for placing houses in the direction the player is facing, rather than using the normal method. Anyhow, I had pulled my virtual machine out of being connected to the SWGEmu project, as I am new to development sharing programs like Git, etc. After realizing that it would be super time consuming to manually apply new content to the server, I decided to reconnect and rebuild the whole setup and actually learn how Git works. I renamed my workspace folder, ran the setup script again, and got a pristine new SWGEmu server running on the VM again. Then I created a new branch called Hondo and added back many of the changes I had previously made. I now have 5 &quot;commits&quot; to Hondo, comprised of all the changes I liked from my previous server and some new items. This new server is definitely more refined, thanks to my previous experience with the code and playing on the server. Here are some things I have learned about SWG as a single player game. 1. While it will be really cool when I finish making the NPC Merchant System, it's much more complicated than I had anticipated and requires/deserves time to create it properly. As such, it made a lot of sense in the mean time (or in the absence of such a system) to use the Admin account to serve as an NPC merchant. I locked a full &quot;Blue Frog&quot; in a player structure and from that I can pull loads of items to sell (that won't be branded System Generated). I can also generate resources to sell. Previously I had placed some BER 3 harvesters for the player to manage, but that's such a pain in the rear and not very flexible. So to better facilitate selling items as the admin, I put the Bazaar sales up to 100 items at 100,000 credit price tag and the listing time of the Bazaar and Merchant vendors to be 180 days. May as well use the tools at hand, right?2. I'm pretty much &quot;over&quot; grinding crafting. Honestly, there's just no point to making 5,000 of the same thing in practice mode just to level a profession. It doesn't teach the player anything and it's not any fun either. The 3x XP rate is actually good enough to level Artisan just making the tools and items you'll want to use, but NONE of the advanced crafting professions can be leveled like this - it's grind or never get there. Even at 250% XP times 3x XP, the grind for Armorsmith was boring drudgery. As such, I'm just using the Admin account to grant crafting professions to my characters. The real fun of crafting is finding the stuff to craft things with and then making the stuff!3. Entertainer has always been pretty pointless as a profession, but it and Politician, Squad Leader, and Merchant are even less valuable in a single player environment. I would grant these skills with the Admin account if was to use them. In fact, my admin character is a Master Merchant. 4. The best places to live are in the NPC cities. Many cities already have a lot of available housing, some partly decorated, some completely empty. While one certainly could make their own city (and even have it act as a starport), I much prefer to live in my favorite Star Wars city, Mos Espa! 5. Being able to toggle off zoning restrictions to place buildings inside NPC cities is great! Place factories, harvesters, and housing as you see fit. Placing a player city over top of an NPC city can cause issues though, such as breaking shuttle functionality. This can be fixed, but to me doing so is more trouble than it's worth.6. Coming from an MMO to a single player game, it can feel a little hollow to play all by one's self. However, there's also a certain amount of joy in knowing that no one is going to come swooping in to ruin your day, just because they feel like being a jerk. I think anyone of the millions of people who enjoy RPGs would have loads of fun with SWG as a single player game. 7. To get the most fun out of the game, using the admin account judiciously is a must. You'll need it to grant admin access to NPC buildings. You'll need it to place buildings where ever you like. It's a great way to make up for the fact that the only person who is putting time into the game is YOU! See there's something fundamental about SWG, it was designed with the &quot;many hands make for light work&quot; concept in mind. When you're the [i:2glhgy9r]ONLY[/i:2glhgy9r] person gathering resources, it's a pretty daunting task. No Galaxy Harvester or SWGCraft to look at. No resources to buy, at any price, even grind resources. There's definitely a clear line between &quot;cheating&quot; and simply filling in the gaps, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. The admin account is a helpful tool.8. Every build really needs a self heal. Aperently  a lot folks who play SWGEmu on Basilisk run a doctor on second account that follows their main character around and heals them. That's a sad solution for a supposedly multi-player game, but it is what it is. Personally, I would rather it be that everyone can use a Stim-A, but the other stims require Medic skill to use. Say every class started with 5 Medicine Use and a self heal ability and Stim-B now requires 10 Med Use. Sadly, I tried all manner of ways to make this happen and all failed to work. Stim-B's requirements can be changed in the Lua file, but [i:2glhgy9r]something[/i:2glhgy9r] else over-rides it. Granting the Heal Damage skill using a custom skills.iff puts the skills in the UI, but even when skills.iff is loaded on the server the skill is not actually granted. And so on. Anyhow, the long and the short of it is that Medic is useful in a single player environment, which is conveniently something I personally find fun.I enjoy playing on my personal server, however the best part of the experience is that no matter what &quot;I think would be cool&quot;, I can actually go ahead and try to make it happen! We could just never do that on the SOE servers, or even on SWGEmu servers that are hosted by others. I guess that must be the draw of games like Minecraft as well. Making an entire computer game from scratch is a huge amount of work that requires a multitude of skill sets, from programming to story to visual art. I'm great at organizing things, decent at programming things, and alright at simple music production, but I am a terrible visual artist and I have next to no experience with 3D modeling. I've made maps for some games over the years, but that more like Lego than actually 3D modeling, especially when you start adding animation and texture creation into it the equation. So with that in mind, working with the SWGEmu engine and the SWG client is fantastic, as there is a wide array of existing assets to manipulate - things that would take me hundreds of thousands of years to create on my own. It wasn't so bad making new art when I made Rescue Girlies, but in that game the biggest items I created were 2D images less than 100 pixels wide. Even then, at least 95% of the art in Rescue Girlies was created by all the kind folks who made Supuer Tux. But, I digress... At the end of the day, Legend of Hondo is the Star Wars sandbox I always wished I had. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->
