I created this server side mod as a way to learn my way around the SWGEmu scripting code base. It's basically a potentially useful &quot;Hello World&quot; project that acts as a tutorial. To make this tutorial I referenced the guides in the SWGEmu Development Discussion forum and chatted with folks on the #opendev irc channel. Thank you muchly to all who helped!This is a server side mod that was created using the screenplay logic. It places an NPC into the world and lets players buy an item with credits through a standard conversation. It consists of 3 files, which you can download in a zip file [url=http&#58;//www&#46;tpot&#46;ca/games/swg/mods/crazy_larry_final_one_item&#46;tar&#46;bz2:1tgukohc]here[/url:1tgukohc]. To use it, extract it and copy the files into your test server's corresponding directories (folders). Then open up the README file for a guide on the very simple process of registering the three files with the server. Doing this manually is part of the learning experience!The screenplay logic file is thoroughly commented, as I like to do. However, here is the full and detailed tutorial!
