This turned out to be easier than I thought, but here's a guide on it anyhow. All you need for this to work is, 1. A functional Core3 server running in Linux.2. The screen and watch commands.To make this work all you need to do is:1. Open a terminal window. 2. Give the terminal window a name that can be referenced by other terminals, [b:2jo93sz4]screen -S yourName[/b:2jo93sz4]3. In that nicely named terminal navigate to the bin folder like so, [b:2jo93sz4]cd ~/workspace/MMOCoreORB/bin[/b:2jo93sz4]4. Open another terminal window or tab. 5. Use the watch command in the other tab to try and start the server every 5 minutes. If it's segmentation faulted already, it will restart. If the server is still running then the server's command line just states &quot;unknown command&quot; each time we pass a command to the terminal it's running in (which is no big deal).[b:2jo93sz4]watch -n300 screen -S hondo -p 0 -X stuff &quot;./core3$(printf \\r)&quot; [/b:2jo93sz4]6. When you are finished using your server, be sure to type exit on the terminal where you ran the screen command in step 2. This ensures you can use the same name again (and closes the terminal completely).--------------I am sure there are more complex ways of automatically managing the server, but this is something simple that is good enough to reload it after it crashes.
