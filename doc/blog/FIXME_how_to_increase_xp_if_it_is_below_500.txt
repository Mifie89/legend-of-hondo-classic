As part of my learning the SWGEmu code base (and because it's an awesome thing to be able to do!), I am making a single player focused version of the server. Of the many things that I want to change so that a single person can play and have fun, much like in other massive single player games, I wanted make the crafting professions less of a grind. I could of course use the character builder terminal and just give away any skills I want, but that's not really [i:1ml0v9pg]playing a game[/i:1ml0v9pg]. So, I figured a global 3x XP rate plus increasing any crafting XP amount less than 500 up to 500 would cretainly help leveling the crafting professions feel a lot better. Not so much of a pointless grind, but still enough effort to feel like you're earning something. Well, I had a look at all the lua files for the crafting schematics and thankfully there was a value in them for the XP amount they granted. This value could have been locked up in a TRE file, so it's awesome that is not. However, there are hundreds of these file and I sure as heck did not want to change them all by hand! That would be crazy. So, I did a bit of resaerch into the proper syntax to use with the sed command and came up with this line that worked great to replace all XP rates less than 500 with 500. [code:1ml0v9pg]find &#46; -name &quot;*&#46;lua&quot; -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i -e 's/xp = &#91;1-9&#93;&#91;0-9&#93;,\|xp = &#91;1-4&#93;&#91;0-9&#93;&#91;0-9&#93;,/xp = 500,/g'[/code:1ml0v9pg]In a terminal I went to, /home/swgemu/workspace/Core3/MMOCoreORB/bin/scripts/object/draft_schematic/and used the above command. Viola, my work here is done!What the command means:[b:1ml0v9pg]find . -name &quot;*.lua&quot; [/b:1ml0v9pg]- Find any file ending in .lua in this directory and every directory below[b:1ml0v9pg]-print0 | xargs -0[/b:1ml0v9pg]- Send the file to [b:1ml0v9pg] sed -i -e[/b:1ml0v9pg]- Make an in place replacement of the line[b:1ml0v9pg]xp = [1-9][0-9],\|xp = [1-4][0-9][0-9][/b:1ml0v9pg]- &quot;xp = 10 - 99,&quot; OR &quot;xp = 100 - 499&quot;[b:1ml0v9pg]/xp = 500,/g'[/b:1ml0v9pg]- With &quot;xp = 500,&quot;The basic use of sed to replace a line in a file looks like, [code:1ml0v9pg]sed -i -e 's/thing you want to replace/the thing you are replacing it with/g'[/code:1ml0v9pg][b:1ml0v9pg]Update:[/b:1ml0v9pg]So I noticed that the above command didn't get some of the sub directories and I am not 100% sure why. But after I noticed, I got to thinking that really it would make more sense to increase the XP bonus granted by Practice Mode. Turns out, that was as simple as changing a single value in a single file. To do this, head on into workspace/MMOCoreORB/src/server/zone/objects/player/sessions/crafting/CraftingSessionImplementation.cppand change the float value on line 1187 to anything you'd like. The default is 1.05f for 5%. I changed mine to 2.5f for a 250% XP bonus. That ought to take a bite out of the grindy feel leveling the crafting professions.Ps. I reverted my above changes to the draft schematics XP values, in favor of increasing the Practice Mode bonus.
