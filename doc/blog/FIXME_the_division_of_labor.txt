In a single player game, there isn't any. It's you, [i:2lcw2glk]you[/i:2lcw2glk], and [i:2lcw2glk]even more you[/i:2lcw2glk] who gets things done! And with that in mind, a whole lot of the changes I made to SWG for my Legend of Hondo single player server make sense. Indeed, one of the first things I thought was, &quot;Well crap... I guess the first thing I should do is grind Novice Architect so I can make some crafting stations&quot;, because I wasn't going to be able to buy any, [i:2lcw2glk]ever[/i:2lcw2glk]. So I sat back and considered for a while all of the things in Star Wars Galaxies that were designed to require players to work together to achieve. At first I thought that having to do everything on one's own was fantastic, &quot;Hey, look at all this awesome content I can do!&quot;, but after a few days of playing the reality that there simply won't be enough time in life to accomplish all those things started to set in. I thought to myself here there for a week or so, &quot;hmm... boy this is an issue... and I think there's even a name for this concept, but I just can't think of it...&quot; and then it came to me out of the blue one day. The division of labor is, quite simply, the ability to accomplish more in a given time by having many people work at a project simultaneously. Total rocket magic, I know! It's obvious when you think about it, like to the old saying, &quot;many hands make for light work&quot;, but it's something we in modern society thoroughly take for granted in our daily lives - lives that are filled to the brim with the results of many hands working all hours of the day. So as much as I enjoy doing most of the things in SWG, I decided that there was a balancing point between &quot;lots of content&quot; and &quot;way more goals than could ever be accomplished&quot; that needed to be achieved to allow a single player SWG to be a fun and rewarding experience. I would imagine that this is exactly the kind of problem that you won't find in an huge single player RPG like Skyrim, as those games are designed from the ground to played by a single person. As such, they already have the facilities to cater to the needs of the player. That's just not so for SWG as a single player game, especially in the following instances:[b:2lcw2glk]Skill Enhancing Attachments[/b:2lcw2glk] - Even with the most super uber of characters killing mobs AFK 24/7 you're not likely going to get all the SEAs you'd like to use. On a multi player server the work load is shared over hundreds of people. Furthermore, you're able to turn time in to credits and credits into the exact SEAs you want, which is the really large benefit as you can play however you like and still get the nice loot (that can help you play your way even better). [b:2lcw2glk]Furniture[/b:2lcw2glk] - I am sure lots of people like crafting this stuff, but others would prefer to use amazing volumes of massive variety to decorate many buildings, rather than sit there and craft it. When no one is around to buy furniture from, the decorator must also craft every item. This takes away from the time they have to enjoy using the furniture.[b:2lcw2glk]Medic XP[/b:2lcw2glk] - Not that people actually do more than AFK level medic by healing an AFK Entertainer or tumbler, but here's something that simply 100% [i:2lcw2glk]requires[/i:2lcw2glk] another player to achieve. Same goes for Doctor, Combat Medic, and Squad Leader. Now one could simply dual log characters and AFK heal the other character, but if you're going to do that you may as well just grant yourself the skills with the admin account or character builder terminal. So, to make this more sensible and more fun, I decided to grant medical XP for self healing. Now you can level Medic/Doctor/Combat Medic while out there fighting things. I have yet to do anything about Squad Leader though.[b:2lcw2glk]Resources[/b:2lcw2glk] - If you don't go get them, there aren't any. Like none, at all, [i:2lcw2glk]ever[/i:2lcw2glk]. That's probably the biggest difference between a single player and a normal version of SWG. The up side here though is that as a single person, you probably don't [i:2lcw2glk]need[/i:2lcw2glk] huge amounts of resources any way. After much consideration, I think the best way to handle this issue is to use the admin account to generate resources and put them up for sale on a vendor. Set your prices to what you feel is reasonable and go play on your normal account. Of course, with it being your own personal server you can do whatever you like, including just granting the resources for free. Again, because you don't need very many resources you may not want to use the admin account like this, however there very well could be times when a resource type you require might not spawn at all for months. This happened in normal SWG all the time, but the issue was largely alleviated due to many players selling their stock piles slowly over time. Personally, I would limit myself to only admin creating resources that are currently in spawn or are of those special [u:2lcw2glk]types[/u:2lcw2glk] that may take eons to spawn again. This way it keeps the resource game fresh, as I will never know the quality of the resources I'll have available.[b:2lcw2glk]Player Cities[/b:2lcw2glk] - Pretty self explanatory, so suffice to say that even placing and paying the maintenance on a city worth of buildings is a lot of work, let alone actually decorating and using all of those structures. It can be done with multiple characters though, should a person choose to do so.Anyhow, there are many cases where the complete lack of any division of labor becomes a major stumbling point when playing single player version of SWG. Just goes to show how well the game was originally designed! <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->
