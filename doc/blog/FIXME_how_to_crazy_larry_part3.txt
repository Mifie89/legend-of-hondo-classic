The easiest way to create a new character template is to copy an existing one and change the names/values to what you'd like. This saves a lot of typing and reduces the likelihood that you'll make a typo or forget something. However, for this turorial go ahead and navigate toworkspace/Core3/MMOCoreORB/bin/scripts/mobile/quest/naboo/on your server and create a new file called merch_crazy_larry.luaCopy and paste code for Crazy Larry into that file, [code:21loqaq3]merch_crazy_larry = Creature&#58;new {objectName = &quot;@mob/creature_names&#58;commoner&quot;,customName = &quot;Crazy Larry&quot;,socialGroup = &quot;townsperson&quot;,pvpFaction = &quot;townsperson&quot;,faction = &quot;townsperson&quot;,level = 1,chanceHit = 0&#46;25,damageMin = 50,damageMax = 55,baseXp = 113,baseHAM = 180,baseHAMmax = 220,armor = 0,resists = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,-1},meatType = &quot;&quot;,meatAmount = 0,hideType = &quot;&quot;,hideAmount = 0,boneType = &quot;&quot;,boneAmount = 0,milk = 0,tamingChance = 0,ferocity = 0,pvpBitmask = NONE,creatureBitmask = NONE,optionsBitmask = 264, --for conversationdiet = HERBIVORE,templates = {&quot;object/mobile/dressed_criminal_pirate_human_male_01&#46;iff&quot;},lootGroups = {},weapons = {},conversationTemplate = &quot;crazylarry_template&quot;,attacks = {}}CreatureTemplates&#58;addCreatureTemplate(merch_crazy_larry, &quot;merch_crazy_larry&quot;)[/code:21loqaq3]The important aspects of this file, for our purpose of creating a character that stands in one place and talks to the player when they start a conversation, are as follows:[b:21loqaq3]merch_crazy_larry = Creature:new {[/b:21loqaq3]This defines the name of your new creature and is used with call that creates the character template for use by the engine, which is the last line here, [b:21loqaq3]CreatureTemplates:addCreatureTemplate(merch_crazy_larry, &quot;merch_crazy_larry&quot;)[/b:21loqaq3] Note how merch_crazy_larry spelled [i:21loqaq3]exactly the same[/i:21loqaq3] in all three spots.[b:21loqaq3]objectName = &quot;@mob/creature_names:commoner&quot;,[/b:21loqaq3]This will apply the default name of a commoner NPC above your character's head, as pulled from the TRE files. Not very handy for a custom character that you would like to name appropriately. [b:21loqaq3]customName = &quot;Crazy Larry&quot;,[/b:21loqaq3]Thankfully, this tag will over-ride the default name with what ever name you place inside the quotation marks![b:21loqaq3]socialGroup = &quot;townsperson&quot;,pvpFaction = &quot;townsperson&quot;,faction = &quot;townsperson&quot;,[/b:21loqaq3]This allows any player who hasn't killed a whole lot of towns people to interact with the character. You can use this to limit who can interact with the character. Give a quick check if you're duplicating an existing template to make a new one, just to make sure it's what you want.[b:21loqaq3]optionsBitmask = 264, --for conversation[/b:21loqaq3]I read on the SWGEmu wiki that this is required for conversation, but it seemed to work with other values too. But, there it is as suggested.[b:21loqaq3]templates = {&quot;object/mobile/dressed_criminal_pirate_human_male_01.iff&quot;},[/b:21loqaq3]This is the physical appearance of the character that you would like to use. You can look in workspace/Core3/MMOCoreORB/bin/scripts/object/mobile/ and open any of the Lua files to find the .iff file used by the character model you'd like - it's on the last line of the file. There are hundreds of pre-defined characters to use, all based upon characters that exist in the TRE files. Creating an absolutely new custom character is outside of the scope of this tutorial (and my knowledge base). Pick one that's close to what you'd like. <!-- s:) --><img src="{SMILIES_PATH}/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><!-- s:) -->   And that's it, your new character is ready to use anywhere in the game, as many times as you'd like!
