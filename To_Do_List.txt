Legend of Hondo
----------------
"To Do" List
==============================

This a list of things (in no strict order) I have thought 
about doing in the future, much of which I will actually 
do at some point. Once completed, things listed here will 
be moved into the Features Log. For some of my thoughts on 
why I did or didn't make something, go to www.tpot.ca.
________________________________________________________


Enter the Set Designer
(And exit Architect and Shipwright)
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- Remove structure deeds from Architect crafting, making the profession into an "Set Designer" profession that is focused on decor, both inside and outside. This is to allow structure deeds to only be purchased as a "money sink".
- Remove Shipwright, as Legend of Hondo will not be getting Jump to Lightspeed.
- Add craftable versions of many Tatooine style static walls, gates, trees, etc. and treat them as city decorations. This will also include large debris, generators, mock up harvesters, etc. Mock up of ships too, if I can figure that out.
- Add a decoration version of each ship part to the Set Designer.
- Add virtually all targetable tangible objects that aren't otherwise accessable to the player as craftable decorations. 
- Add all "Event Promoter" items as craftable city decoration type objects and remove the "Event Promoter" system. Consolidating systems for consistency and ease of use.


Active Resource Acquisition
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- Nerf hand sampling to 1 unit per type per day, to make it for research rather than AFK "winning the game"...
- Add new Destroy Mission theaters that have mock harvesters and lootable resource containers.
- Add a resource payout to Survey Missions, with diminishing returns to the same location.
- Add a resource payout to Artisan crafting missions.
- Add an NPC merchant at Nado's shop who sells recycled quality resources for 10cpu.
- 500 unit resource deeds are already in the custom, massive, junk loot table.


Pirate Legacy System
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- The world factions system of SWG will finally reach its in Legend of Hondo! Using this system to make your own legacy is the ultimate "point" of playing LoH.
- Add a new "Renown" faction, whose enemy is "Infamy". The player will want to increase his Renown, of course, but being Infamous isn't too bad either, for a pirate!
- Renown is gained though improving Mos Espa by operating businesses that benifit the local population and completing certain (new) quests. 
- Infamy is gained by completing (some types of) destroy missions and embarking on (new) quests to dangerous places. 
- Both Renown and Infamy are automatically lost over time, though the closer the player is to the max of 5,000, the slower his legacy will fade.
- Add a business system, as a screenplay managed by a network of droids. The droids will be in certain existing structures as well as some player placed structures. 
 -- This is a simple economic simulation, with random and controlable factors that effect the player's success. Each structure has services, needs, costs, employees, and patrons of various types. Renown will increase when these factors balance in a profitable way. The trick is keeping the patrons happy, despite their differences!
 -- Managed with a SUI box window system. 
 -- Both Renoun and Infamy will play into the simulation in subtle ways, as will pitting your characters against each other by having more than one running businesses.
- NPC Merchants already factor world factions into their relations with the player , making it easy to add an Renown and Infamy.
- Empire doesn't appreciate Renown and is hostile to Infamy, but the Rebels like Renown and are indifferent to Infamy.
- Townspeople and common folk in general like Renown and dislike Infamy.
- Other pirate factions greatly appreciate Renown and tolerate or are hostile toward Infamy.
- Other world factions will factor in Renown and Infamy in various ways as well, affecting their friendliness, hostility, and the quests/merchants/locations they make available.
- You know you've "beat the game" when one of your characters is able to maintain 5,000 Renown, has above 2,500 Infamy or so (because Pirate!), and has become the mayor of Mos Espa. You're a pirate a who's legacy stands with the legends of Hondo and the other great pirates of the ages!


Reduce the Passage of Time
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- I find that I don't like leaving a computer running just to have time pass in a single player game, but that's how the server/client thing works. However, I can make changes that will reduce the need to run a server all the time, to the point where I can turn it off when I'm not using it and won't impact the game play. Talk about totally different than SWG, eh? :)
- Resource shifts should happen on server boot, but make sure that the system works well enough when turning the server off for days/weeks.
- Disable the Bazaar system and use the terminals for a static sales system.
- Move Merchant perks into Artisan and remove Merchant, because it doesn't need to be a whole profession in the absence of other players.
- Keep the player vendor system, because it could be fun and handy. However, make the listing time 100 years or something crazy so the passage of time doesn't matter. 
- Limit factory run time to a max of 3 seconds per item. A single player doesn't really need huge amounts of items, so I think 20 items per minute is reasonable. 
- Survey missions, where the player searches out spots of X concentration will grant an amount of the located resources as well as credits.
- Remove Harvesters. It pains me to do so, because they are neat and I have spent a lot of time using them over the years, but they don't fit with this experience. As a single player you won't need boat loads of resources and the way harvesters work doesn't jibe with the desire to turn off the server when one's not using it.
- Add new Destroy Mission "theatres" that have harvester models and grant currently spawning resources as a bonus reward. 
- Nerf hand sampling to 1 unit per resource type per hour, there by making it a discovery tool rather than an AFK "I win the game!" exploit.
- Add a network of merchants who sell resources and make a quest that introduces them to the player. They won't sell everything, so the 500 unit resource deeds, survey and destroy missions, will be an important part of locating resources.
- Remove player city functionality. The buffs could be provided in a different way.
- Remove Politician.
- To enhance the usefulness of power type resources, vehicle hitpoint decay will be fuel loss, rather than damage, so the decay is "fixed" by using resource power rather than credits. Each fuel type resource has a different efficiency and the Potential Energy stat plays into it. Garages would still use credits though.
- Buildings won't blow up when the player is out of money and the condemned fees will max at 50,000 credits.


Bring the world to life
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- This is an ongoing project, where I would do a bit a time.
- Replace many useless characters (especially ones that don't seem to make any sense, just standing around...) with quest givers from the disabled planets, merchants, new quest givers, and NPCs tied to world factions that can be attacked.
- Make all the Junk Dealers character and location driven so they feel less gamey.
- Make screenplays for each town that generate NPC (when the player is within range) who spawn, "do something", and then despawn.
- Add more "Points of Interest", "Quest Hubs", etc. Such as...
- Story based content that adds creatures from the disabled planets, such as...
- The zoo gone wrong on Tatooine that turned into a valley where Bio-Engineers from Bestine study the accidentally wild creatures.
- The Northern Endorian infestation of creatures from Yavin4, centered around the abandonded Imperial outpost. 
- And adding other critters to the spawn tables of Dantooine, Dathomir, Endor, Lok, and Tatooine.
- World faction driven content where the player can earn/lose faction with NPCs who live on the disabled planets (Corellia, Talus, Naboo, Rori, and Yavin4).
- Enable and build up Rori, because it has a unique atmosphere to it and a lot of potential.



Economy Adjustments
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- Don't allow some items to be made in factories, because they need to be a "credit sink" and simply aren't when you can make a life time supply of them in an afternoon.
- Vehicles: Only purchased from Crazy Larry, apart from some NGE era models that I will (eventually) add as looted single use crafting schematics.



Merchant System Improvements
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- Inject a reply option that opens an inventory window where the player can fully inspect the items that are for sale.
- Options for Smugglers to try for discounts (and perhaps outright theft). 
- Stock limations based on month, scarcity, faction standing, and stock levels.
- Add more merchants, mostly as part of world faction content. This includes Geo Cave loot and other high priced consuables that will act as major credit sinks.
- Repurpose the Bazaar terminals to be a merchant system with a UI similar to the Crate of Free Reources. These terminals are all over the galaxy already, so it would make sense to use them for something.



Imperial / Rebel Improvements
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- Add tiggers to prevent neutral characters from tresspassing on Rebel/Imperial land, because it doesn't make any sense for people to be able walk in there and do whatever they want.
- Imprison neutrals who are caught tresspassing. Another character will have to bail (NPC conversation + credits) them out or break them out (quest + combat).
- Add a free travel system that links faction facilities together. 
- Add more faction items for purchase.
- Rebuild the Rebel and Imperial themeparks so they  take place on the available planets. 
- Move other faction related content to the available planets. 
- Add battles/invasions that the player can instigate through quests and take part in.
- Add Rebel and Imperial convoys that the player can plunder, as randomly spawned "theaters".
- Beef up the ownership of cities on Tatooine, which should be interesting when I add more reasons to go to these cities. Rebel: Anchorhead, Mos Eisley. Imperial: Bestine, Mos Entha.



Personal Ship Improvements
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- It's a little wonky (and a bit buggy) as it is, but I may be able to spruce it up a bit. 
- Only works on Tatooine, as that's where they are stationed.
- Place some models in the second starport in Mos Espa and add some related quest content.
- Tie the functionality to an inventory item so it can be placed on the toolbar and used (because opening the datapad is hard! lol...). 
- The ship flies down to the player's position and the player double clicks it to get in.
- Add vertical and reverse thrusters for a more space-shippy feel.




Smuggling / Bounty Hunting 
= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 
- Limit bounty targets to spawning only on planets that are enabled.
- Add some repeatable, multi-part smuggling missions that are interesting and different each time.
- Have treasure maps as a possible reward. 
- Make treasure maps indicate the planet where the treasure is on and if the planet is not one the player can access, let them know the map is useless. Such is life!
